    "In this project, I chose to focus on customer churn in banks, a dynamic and expanding sector. By examining customer demographics and purchasing behaviors, I aim to gain valuable insights into how different customer groups influence retention and profitability. This analysis is crucial for refining marketing strategies and enhancing customer engagement, making it particularly useful for financial institutions looking to optimize their operations and reduce churn.\n",

    "The (CSV) dataset that I analyzed in this project comes from [Radheshyam Kollipara](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/radheshyamkollipara/bank-customer-churn). This project is focused on excel so firstly I loaded the CSV into excel to preview the data and find out what would be the ideal key insights to extract, and identify the necessary data cleaning steps to ensure an effective analysis."

    "\n",
    "This project examines customer data to identify key trends in credit scores, product usage, customer balances, and demographic factors such as gender and geography. The analysis provides valuable insights for optimizing marketing strategies and customer engagement efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Credit Score Distribution by Geography**  \n",
    "   The average credit scores across France, Spain, and Germany are similar, with Germany showing the highest average at **651.45**, followed by Spain (**651.33**) and France (**649.67**). Though differences are small, this insight can be leveraged to tailor region-specific financial services, especially in regions with higher creditworthiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Impact of Age and Tenure on Product Usage**  \n",
    "   Customers with **1-2 years** of tenure consistently have higher product usage across all age groups, with younger customers (20-29) using slightly more products (**1.56 products**) than older customers (50-59). Tenure has a more pronounced effect on product usage, with shorter-tenured customers using fewer products. This suggests that banks could focus on engaging new customers to increase product adoption early in their relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Correlation Between Balance and Factors like Credit Score, Geography, and Tenure**  \n",
    "   Longer tenure is associated with higher balances, particularly in Germany, where customers with **1-2 years** of tenure hold the highest average balance (**₹119,095.92**). The correlation between geography and balance suggests that German customers are likely to hold more wealth over time. Understanding these patterns helps financial institutions focus retention strategies on high-value customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Key Differences Between Male and Female Customers**  \n",
    "   Female customers have a slightly higher average balance (**₹75,659.37**) compared to male customers (**₹77,173.97**). Females also have a slightly higher average credit score (**650.83**) and product usage (**1.54 products**) than males. These differences, though subtle, suggest that female customers may be more engaged with banking products, presenting opportunities for gender-targeted marketing campaigns.  \n",
